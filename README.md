# Old WebGL Shader Demos

Thee little demos I made to learn how to use shaders in WebGL back
when the technology was still fairly new.

See these in action:
 - [waves](https://games.gridbugs.org/old-webgl-shader-demos/waves/)
 - [tiles](https://games.gridbugs.org/old-webgl-shader-demos/tiles/)
 - [pavement](https://games.gridbugs.org/old-webgl-shader-demos/pavement/artwork/shaders/irregular_pavement/)
 
This repo also contains code from a long abandoned game engine which
I never finished, as the demos use the low-level graphics library
from the engine. Read more [here](https://www.gridbugs.org/post-mortem-of-abandoned-game/).
